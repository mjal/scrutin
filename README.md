## Features

##### Belenios integration

- [x] Encrypt Ballot on device

##### Public key infrastructure

- [x] Every action (called a transaction) must be signed by an authorized identity
- [x] Transactions
	- [x] Election creation. From election organizer
	- [x] Ballot emission (adding a new voter identity). From election organizer
	- [x] Ballot filling. From voter
- [ ] Running a main public pod
- [ ] Merging divergent transactions logs
	Note: the signed events do not include a `previous` field like in SecureScuttleButt. Making merging easier (maybe using Lamport Clock) 

##### UI/UX

- [ ] Inspect deroulement of an elections (how many empty/filled ballots)

##### Nice to have
